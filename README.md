# Theming
The application supports both light and dark themes. The theme state is managed using the Context API, which can be found in the common/themes folder. If you want to customize the existing theme, you can adjust the light and dark themes according to your needs. You can add new theme as well. Its very easy to setup. Just create a new file and define all the Theme Properties and then switch that theme in the AppThemeProvider. That's it.
